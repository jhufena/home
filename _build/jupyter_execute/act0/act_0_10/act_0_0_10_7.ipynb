    "The `deploy_viewer_static()` function is a shell script that automates the deployment of a static website to the `gh-pages` branch of a GitHub repository. Here's a breakdown of what each line is doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `cd /tmp`: Changes the current working directory to the `/tmp` directory, which is often used for storing temporary files on Unix-like operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/everypolitician/viewer-static.git`: Clones the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/everypolitician/viewer-static.git` into the `/tmp` directory. The `--depth=1` flag indicates that only the latest commit is fetched, making the clone operation faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `cd viewer-static`: Changes the current working directory to the newly cloned `viewer-static` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `git checkout gh-pages`: Switches to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository. This branch is often used for hosting static websites on GitHub Pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `cp -R /tmp/localhost:4567/* .`: Copies all files from the `/tmp/localhost:4567/` directory to the current (`viewer-static`) directory. The `-R` flag indicates that the operation should be recursive, copying all subdirectories and their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `git add .`: Stages all the new and modified files in the current directory for a git commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `git -c \"user.name=everypoliticianbot\" -c \"user.email=everypoliticianbot@users.noreply.github.com\" commit -m \"Automated commit\" || true`: Commits the staged changes to the repository with the commit message \"Automated commit\". The commit is made under the username `everypoliticianbot` and email `everypoliticianbot@users.noreply.github.com`. The `|| true` part ensures that even if the commit fails, the script continues execution without error.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `git push origin gh-pages`: Pushes the committed changes to the `gh-pages` branch of the remote GitHub repository, thereby updating the GitHub Pages website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the script automates the process of updating a static website hosted on GitHub Pages by pulling the latest version of the website from a repository, copying new files into it, and then pushing the changes back to the repository. This is a common pattern for automating the deployment of static websites and should be adopted for this project."
