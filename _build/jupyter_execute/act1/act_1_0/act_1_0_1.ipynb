    "   The CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation is a formula often used to estimate the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function. The CKD-EPI 2009 equation, while more accurate than the older MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) equation, raised issues of justice and equity in the United States due to its inclusion of race as a variable. It's worth noting that these issues have yet to garner attention in other countries.\n",
