    "2. **Strengthen Your Defense:** Incorporate regular audits and peer reviews by submitting your work or proposaal to a friend, colleague, conference, journal, or the NIH.\n",
    "3. **Go on the Offense:** Utilize cutting-edge tools akin to generative adversarial networks to outsmart sloppiness. Embrace this platform, [*Fena*](https://jhutrc.github.io/beta/intro.html), and its associated resources. Step up your game and become a better researcher; get in the \"flow\" and enjoy the process.\n",
