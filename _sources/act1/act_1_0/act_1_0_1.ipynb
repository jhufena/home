    "Michel Foucault was a French philosopher and social theorist known for his explorations of power, knowledge, and institutions. His work has been highly influential across a range of disciplines including philosophy, history, sociology, and more. One of his major contributions is the idea that power is not merely a top-down force exerted by a sovereign, but a complex structure that operates in all aspects of life, often in covert ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Foucault often examined the relationship between `knowledge` (\"savoir\"), `power/truth` (\"pouvoir\"), and `visibility/justice` (\"voir\"). He argued that power and knowledge are intertwined; one cannot exist without the other. Institutions, according to Foucault, use knowledge to exert power, and those in power control what counts as knowledge. The concept of visibility comes into play in his discussions of panopticism, a social theory named after the Panopticon, a type of prison building designed by Jeremy Bentham. In a Panopticon, all prisoners can be observed by a single watchman without the prisoners being able to tell whether they are being watched, thus leading them to self-regulate their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foucault's ideas have been instrumental in understanding how societal institutions‚Äîfrom prisons and hospitals to schools and the military‚Äîfunction to shape and control individuals. His work remains a cornerstone of critical theory and has inspired countless studies examining the nexus of power, knowledge, and visibility in various contexts.\n",

    "The CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation is a formula often used to estimate the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function. The CKD-EPI 2009 equation, while more accurate than the older MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) equation, raised issues of justice and equity in the United States due to its inclusion of race as a variable. It's worth noting that these issues have yet to garner attention in other countries.\n",
