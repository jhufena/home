    "  \n",
    "The [Project](https://github.com/jhurepos/projectgamma/tree/main/act_1) investigates a critical area of concern in the field of organ transplantation, particularly for live kidney donors (LKDs). It delves into long-term risks that are often `overlooked due to the limited mandated follow-up period`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of methodology, the use of a multicenter retrospective cohort design adds robustness to the findings, and the long period of follow-up (20 years) provides a comprehensive look at post-donation adverse events, enhancing the generalizability of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings related to the factors that predict all-cause hospitalization, such as age at donation, female sex, and post-donation diabetes/hypertension, are noteworthy. These risk factors can help inform screening and **long-term follow-up strategies** for LKDs, possibly mitigating some of these risks. It also underscores the need for extended surveillance, particularly in donors with diabetes and hypertension.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Data Validation**: Given that patient factors were primarily self-reported, have you considered validating these against medical records for a subset of the population?\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Counterfactual Analysis**: A counterfactual analysis could help estimate what could happen under different conditions (e.g., if they had not donated; ie a healthy nondonor cohort followed for hospitalization over 20 years).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ethical Implications**: Providing this information transparently to prospective donors could be considered an ethical obligation, and the findings could influence informed consent procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Implementation into Practice**: These findings could be crucial for policy change, emphasizing the need for extended follow-up for LKDs, possibly even lifetime follow-up for certain high-risk groups (Medicare for donors??).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Version Control**: Invite coauthors to use the platform to provide feedback on the [project](https://github.com/jhurepos/projectgamma/tree/main/act_1). Get a GitHub account and do direct commits to the repo. Also include the Stata code for the analysis.\n",
